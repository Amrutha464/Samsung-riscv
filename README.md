### RISC-V Talent Development Program  
The **RISC-V Talent Development Program** is an initiative powered by **Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR)** in collaboration with **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.  

As part of this program, participants are given **6 tasks** to complete over the course of one month. Those who successfully complete all 6 tasks will receive an **Appreciation Certificate** from both **Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR)** and **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.  

These certificates are recognized as highly prestigious in the fields of **RISC-V** and **VLSI design**, making this program a valuable opportunity for students and professionals alike to enhance their expertise in these cutting-edge domains.  

The instructor for this program is Kunal Ghosh.

## TASK-1:
Create a GitHub repository named **"samsung-riscv"**, install the RISC-V toolchain using the provided VDI link, follow the steps from the shared lab videos, and capture dated snapshots of the work. Upload the snapshots to the repository with brief descriptions.

## TASK-2:
Run the simulation and analyze the performance using the `-O1` and `-Ofast` compiler optimization flags. Write a simple C program (any basic application) and compile it using RISC-V GCC/SPIKE with both optimization options. Generate the RISC-V object dumps for each optimization level and upload the files to the repository.
